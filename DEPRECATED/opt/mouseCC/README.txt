Using biomaRt dynamically to get mouse homoglous of human cell cycle
is a f*cking pain. Constantly get errors like:
```
Ensembl site unresponsive, trying asia mirror
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
  Peer's Certificate issuer is not recognized.
```

So just make a static list of the mouse cell cycle genes here
to use in the main scripts.
